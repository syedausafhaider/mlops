Mean_squared_error
Mean_absolute_error
r2_score


These are performance metric for regression algorithm.
Regression algorithm under supervised technique => which have target data as numerical data

(Y_actual - y_predicted)^2= error^2

100 observations
100 errors

for all 100 error ====>  Mean_error

Mean squared error
------------------
How much error the model is giving ?

if the error is less, then the model is good
	otherwise the model is bad.

Elastic model --> is a regression model having 2 arguments
1) alpha ratio
2) l1_ratio

we need to save our model artifacts model version, model tracking and model register === MLOPS
